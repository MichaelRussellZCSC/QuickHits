#File Organization#

The internet is like being a kid in a candystore when it comes to downloading stuff to learn.  Almost every site has something they ask you to download, a GITHub repository to clone, PDF documents, you name it.  When you start it is natural just to hit the download button and almost immediately you are starting down the path of learning whatever you just found.

**Don't**

If you are wondering what will probably be the first thing that drags your momentum to a complete standstill nothing will hit you harder or faster than file organization.
